## 📂 Dataset Information
- **Dataset:** Customer Shopping Behavior
- **Format:** CSV
- **Domain:** Retail / E-commerce Analytics
- **Data Includes:**
  - Customer demographics (age group, gender)
  - Purchase amount and product details
  - Discounts, shipping type, and subscription status
  - Previous purchase history

---

## 🔍 Methodology
### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Cleaning (Python)
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Checked data types and distributions
- Performed descriptive analysis

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed revenue distribution across customer groups
- Studied spending patterns and purchase behavior
- Compared subscribed vs non-subscribed customers
- Segmented customers based on purchase history

### 3️⃣ SQL-Based Business Analysis
- Solved real-world business questions using SQL
- Used **GROUP BY, CASE, CTEs, subqueries, and window functions**
- Focused on revenue, customer segments, and product performance

---

## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered
- How does **revenue vary by gender**?
- Which customers used **discounts but still spent above average**?
- What are the **top-rated products**?
- How does spending differ between **standard and express shipping**?
- Do **subscribed customers** spend more than non-subscribers?
- Which products have the **highest discount usage**?
- How can customers be segmented into **New, Returning, and Loyal**?
- What are the **top products in each category**?
- Are **repeat buyers** more likely to subscribe?
- How does **revenue vary by age group**?

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard (KPI View Included)
An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was developed using the same dataset to present insights in a **business-friendly and interactive format**.

### 🔑 KPI View (Top Summary Section)
The dashboard starts with a KPI view that provides an instant summary of business performance:
- **Total Revenue**
- **Total Customers**
- **Average Purchase Amount**
- *(Optional)* **Subscription Rate (%)**

### Dashboard Capabilities
- Analysis by **Gender, Age Group, Product Category, and Subscription Status**
- Interactive slicers for filtering and drill-down
- Clear separation between **KPI summary** and **detailed analysis visuals**

---

## 🔑 Key Insights
- Certain **age groups contribute significantly higher revenue**
- **Subscribed customers** show higher average and total spending
- Discounts influence purchase behavior without significantly reducing revenue
- **Loyal (repeat) customers** represent a high-value segment
- Power BI enables stakeholders to explore insights interactively

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project showcases how **Python EDA, SQL analysis, and Power BI dashboards** can be combined to generate meaningful customer insights and support data-driven decision making in a retail context.
